## Active Issues - Needs Investigation/Fix

### üîß Immediate Priority Issues

#### Signal Routing & Bypass Controls Investigation
**Priority**: Completed
**Component**: DSP/Signal Processing
**Description**: Comprehensive analysis of signal routing architecture and control mechanisms
**Branch**: V3.5.0_routingResearch

**Key Findings**:
1. **Bypass Controls**:
   - D-BYP and C-BYP controls implement sophisticated click-free signal bypass
   - Exponential fade curves: 10ms fade-out, 5ms fade-in for smooth transitions
   - Independent section control allowing granular signal management

2. **Signal Routing Architecture**:
   - Three routing modes: DelayToComb, CombToDelay, DelayPlusComb
   - RoutingManager with 10ms smooth transitions between modes
   - Professional signal flow design with minimal latency

3. **Dry/Wet Processing**:
   - Hierarchical mixing system with multi-stage controls
   - Global dry/wet (kGlobalDryWet) parameter
   - Delay-specific dry/wet control (kDelayDryWet)
   - Comb section always 100% wet by design

**Improvement Areas Identified**:
1. **Feedback Routing**: Currently global rather than section-specific
2. **Parallel Mode**: Fixed 0.5f scaling, no user control over delay/comb balance
3. **Transition Timing**: 10ms may be insufficient for very long delays
4. **Buffer Management**: Routing mode changes should clear all buffers to prevent artifacts

**User Experience Issues Identified**:
5. **Missing Gain Controls**: Need individual gain controls for Comb and Delay processors (not just global input/output)
6. **Dry/Wet UI Confusion**: Only one dry/wet control visible in UI, unclear if it's Global or Delay dry/wet
7. **UI Parameter Mismatch**: GUI doesn't expose both kGlobalDryWet and kDelayDryWet parameters
8. **Buffer State Issues**: Routing mode changes don't clear processor buffers, causing audio artifacts

**Implementation Recommendations**:
1. Implement section-specific feedback routing
2. Add individual Delay and Comb gain controls to DSP and GUI
3. Expose both Global and Delay dry/wet controls in UI (currently only one visible)
4. Add buffer clearing to routing mode transitions
5. Introduce dynamic scaling for parallel processing
6. Add user-controllable parallel mix balance
7. Fine-tune routing transition timing (current 10ms)

**Status**: Investigation Complete ‚úì

## Implementation Plan - Signal Routing Improvements

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: C-GAIN Parameter (COMPLETE)
**Status**: Complete ‚úì
**Time**: 4 hours
**Branch**: V3.1_combGUI

**Completed:**
- Added kCombGain parameter with professional -40dB to +12dB range
- DSP integration with proper dB scaling in CombProcessor
- GUI layout updated to accommodate 10 comb parameters
- VST3 validation: 47/47 tests passed

### üîÑ Phase 2: Intelligent Comb SIZE/DIV Knob
**Priority**: High
**Component**: GUI/DSP
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Remove kCombDivision parameter from WaterStickParameters.h
2. Enhance CombProcessor with intelligent parameter handling:
   - Add backup value storage (mStoredTimeValue, mStoredDivisionValue)
   - Implement setCombSizeParameter() with mode-aware conversion
   - Add logarithmic time scaling (100Œºs-2.0s) and division mapping
3. Update GUI logic for intelligent knob behavior:
   - Modify valueChanged() handler for context-sensitive display
   - Implement time/division format switching
4. Reduce comb layout back to 3√ó3 grid (9 parameters)

**Expected Outcome**: Single SIZE/DIV knob that adapts behavior based on SYNC mode, matching delay section pattern

### üîÑ Phase 3: Section-Specific Feedback Routing
**Priority**: High
**Component**: DSP/Audio Processing
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Add separate feedback parameters: kDelayFeedback, enhance kCombFeedback routing
2. Implement independent feedback buffers in WaterStickProcessor
3. Add feedback routing logic based on routing mode (DelayToComb, CombToDelay, DelayPlusComb)
4. Apply tanh limiting to prevent runaway feedback
5. Update parameter system and GUI controls

**Expected Outcome**: Independent feedback control for delay and comb sections with proper routing

### üîÑ Phase 4: Hierarchical Dry/Wet Controls
**Priority**: Medium
**Component**: GUI/User Experience
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Expose kDelayDryWet parameter in GUI (currently hidden)
2. Rename current DRY/WET knob to G-MIX (global dry/wet)
3. Add D-MIX control to delay section layout
4. Update parameter mapping and display logic
5. Implement visual hierarchy for control sections

**Expected Outcome**: Clear separation between section-specific (D-MIX) and global (G-MIX) dry/wet controls

### üîÑ Phase 5: Dynamic Parallel Processing
**Priority**: Medium
**Component**: DSP/GUI
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Add kParallelBalance parameter (0-100%)
2. Implement equal-power crossfading in DelayPlusComb mode
3. Add BALANCE knob with contextual activation (only active in D+C mode)
4. Update routing manager for user-controllable mixing
5. Replace fixed 0.5f scaling with dynamic user control

**Expected Outcome**: User-controllable balance between delay and comb in parallel mode

### üîÑ Phase 6: Buffer Clearing & Transition Optimization
**Priority**: Low
**Component**: DSP/Performance
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Implement 64-sample buffer clearing during routing transitions
2. Add adaptive transition timing (5-50ms based on delay lengths)
3. Update RoutingManager with enhanced transition logic
4. Add kTransitionTime parameter for user control
5. Comprehensive buffer state management

**Expected Outcome**: Artifact-free routing transitions with optimized timing

### üìä Implementation Summary
**Total Estimated Time**: 28-38 hours (Phase 1 complete: 4 hours remaining)
**Current Progress**: Phase 1 ‚úì, Phase 2 in progress
**Risk Level**: Medium (DSP architecture changes require careful testing)
**Testing Strategy**: VST3 validation + professional audio testing after each phase
